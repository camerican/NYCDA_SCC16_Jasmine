	<p>Less than a week until the start of the Summer Olympics, 
	results from a <a href = "http://bigstory.ap.org/2c9894db31b74fc081d7f1ee3f0cf673">16-month AP study shows</a> 
	that key bodies of water 
	for Olympic events in Rio are as filthy as ever, teeming with 
	dangerous levels of bacteria, viruses, and raw human sewage.
	
	<br></br>
	Now comes an ominous warning from a top biologist.
	
	<br></br>
	"Don't put your head under water," Dr. Valerie Harwood, 
	the chair of the University of South Florida's 
	Integrative Biology Department, <a href = "http://bigstory.ap.org/2c9894db31b74fc081d7f1ee3f0cf673">warned athletes 
	and tourists alike on Monday</a>.
	
	<br></br>
	Last year, the first results of the same AP study 
	showed viral levels up to 1.7 million times worse 
	than what would be considered dangerous in the 
	United States. Ingesting just three tablespoons 
	of water, the <a href = "http://bigstory.ap.org/2c9894db31b74fc081d7f1ee3f0cf673">
	AP said</a>, would result in "violent" illness.
		
	<br></br>
	Now, at the conclusion of the AP's study over 16 months, infectious adenovirus 
	readings turned up at 90% of test sites. 
	
	<br></br>
	"That's a very, very, very high percentage,"  Harwood said. "Seeing that 
	level of human pathogenic virus is pretty much unheard of in surface waters 
	in the U.S. You would never, ever see these levels because we treat our waste 
	water. You just would not see this." 

	<br></br>
	The Brazilian scientist commissioned by the AP to test the waters said 
	there had been no marked improvement over the past year.

	<br></br>
	"Unfortunately, what we've seen throughout all this time is that 
	there is a variation in the levels of contamination, but it fluctuates 
	much more as a result of climactic conditions than due to any measures 
	that may have been taken to try to remove this contamination," said Dr. Fernando Spilki, 
	the virologist and coordinator of the molecular microbiology laboratory at Feevale University.

	<br></br>
	According to the study, the two worst locations are the Rodrigo de Freitas 
	lagoon, where the rowing events will take place, and the Gloria Marina, 
	where the sailing events will begin.
